The text is designed for japanese characters. As such, I took a few creative liberties with the letters:
bh","b
tch","tu
ch","t
dh","d
fh","f
gh","g
jh","j
kh","k
lh","l
mh","m
nh","n
ph","f
qh","q
rh","r
she","si
sh","s
th","t
vh","v
wh","w
xh","x
zh","z
ci","si
ce","se
c","k
j","z
f","h
l","r
q","k
shi","si
tsu","tu
wi","wa
we","wa
wo","wu
v","h
x","k
ye","ya
yi","ya
double consonants are removed
double vowels are turned into single vowels plus vowel lengthener

additionally, to ease on the programming, several of the character names were remade:
ji#1 = zi
ji#2 = di
zu#2 = du
fu = hu
chi = ti
tsu = tu
shi = si
wo = wu
be#1 = bi
